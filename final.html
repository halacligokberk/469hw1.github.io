            <h3>Project Overview</h3>

        In this project we rendered a nature scene that contains a Sakura tree
        shedding its flowers, and a lake that captures the reflection of the sakura
        tree and the environment. Let’s go over each part one by one.

        <br>

            <h3>Sakura Tree & Falling Flowers</h3>

        
                    We used royalty-free tree and flower models and rendered them directly.
        For simulating the falling flowers we utilized the GPU as much as we can. We
        used Shader Storage Buffer Objects(SSBOs) to store the per flower state. We
        used separate buffers for state data such as the position, rotation, movement and
        randomization which we tell in more detail. In every rendering pass those
        buffers are updated by a compute buffer. This greatly increases the
        performance of our application by taking a burden from the CPU. Now lets talk
        about the leaf movement and our buffers.
                
        <br>

        Each flower/leaf does two main movements, they rotate around
        themselves and follow a helix-like shape while falling. To create a helix, they
        make a constant velocity movement in the y-axis with some perturbations.
        Whereas in the x-axis they follow a parametrized sinus curve that can be
        formulated as follows:

                <br>
        
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">
        
                X_new = X_start + C*sin(omega*t + P) + noise

                </code></pre>

                <br>
    
            The constant C is the circumference of the helix, t is the frequency it
        controls how fast the flowers are spinning and P is the Phase movement
        constant. We also add a scalar Perlin noise component to increase
        randomness.

        <br>

        To simulate the self-centered rotation, we use the following formula:
            
            <br>
            
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">

            R_new = R_start + 0.005 + noise (mod 360)
                
            </code></pre>


            <br>
        We use Euclid angles since GLSL doesn’t have any built-in quaternion support.
        We basically initialize the rotation of leaves with random numbers in their
        spawn points and rotate them repeatedly in each axis by a random amount.
        The relationship between the buffers and the aforementioned numbers are as
        follows:

            <br>

            <ul>
            <li>Position SSBO: Stores the current position of the leaf.</li>
            <li>Rotation SSBO: Stores the current self-centered rotation state of the leaf.</li>
            <li>Randomizer SSBO: Stores the randomizer constants for the helix movement.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

                Now we are all set for rendering. Since we are going to render flowers in
            masses, we need an efficient way other than rendering the flowers in a for
            loop. Instanced rendering is the way-to-go for this case, it also very easy to
            use ! We just replace glDrawElements call with glDrawElementsInstanced and
            provide the number of instances to render as an additional argument. So, what
            is the difference between these two? In glDrawElements, CPU tells the GPU to
            draw only once and drawing repeatedly in a for loop comes with a CPU-GPU
            communication overhead. In instanced drawing CPU tells the GPU to draw
            multiple times and this greatly reduces the overhead. Instanced rendering also
            provides a built-in gl_InstanceID argument to the vertex shader. This
            argument stores the id number (starting from zero) of the argument that is
            currently rendering in the shader. With this id we can select the related
            information from the SSBOs during the rendering process.

            <br>
            <br>

            Now we can simulate just a group of flowers falling from the tree.
            To make it a repeated motion we need to spawn new flowers regularly. We can
            do this by extending the SSBOs regularly. However this comes with a
            downside, extending and SSBO is a really expensive operation because it
            requires us to allocate more space in the GPU, create new data in the CPU
            and copy it to GPU. This causes the program to lag during the new flower
            spawns. Here is a video that shows it:
                        <br>

          </video>


                        <br>

            After giving it some thought, we decided to preallocate a certain amount of
            SSBO space (and never allocate again) during the program initialization and
            increase the number of flowers we are rendering regularly. This solves the
            performance issue but puts a limit on how many flowers can fall from the tree.
            We can have a limit of 100.000 without any problems so I think it is okay since
            most trees don’t have that many flowers.

            <h3>Water with Reflections</h3>

                        <br>


            Our project also captures a lake where you can see the reflection
                of the environment, distorted view of the sakura tree and, there are also flowers floating on it.

                  
                    <br>

        Let’s talk about the technical parts of the lake. First of all, there is no
        lake. What you see in the screen is a waving mirror (like the ones you see in
        amusement parks).

                <br>

                    <figure>
              <img src="image.png" alt="image credits: https://decorativeantiques.uk/products/fairground-distortion-

mirror?variant=41598986485826 </figcaption>
    
            </figure>

            <br>

            The funny thing is the mirror is not actually waving, the waving effect is
done in shader by creating distorted normals. And the mirror is … is a mirror,
no tricks in there :)

            <br>
        Now lets examine the technical parts.

            <br>

            <h4>The Mirror</h4>

                        <br>


                    There are numerous ways to create reflections in graphics, we didn’t
        want to use ray-tracing to make the program lighter. Most of the methods
        outside ray-tracing are some version of using a “reflected” camera across the
        mirror surface and using the renders of that camera as the reflections.
        There are multiple ways to implement this approach, one way is to
        literally reflect the main camera by keeping a second camera which has the
        matrices of a reflected camera.

                    <br>

We tried this first but we encountered several issues:

            <br>

            <ul>
        <li> If we move the actual camera(POV of the user), we need to apply the correct
        version of that transformation to the mirrored camera. It was complicated for
        us to find those correct versions, we ended up having the tree and its
        reflection going to different directions when we move the camera.
        </li>
        
        <li> The other issue is the left and right of the mirrored and original cameras are
        inverted because of that, the reflection was not right to begin with
        </li>
        </ul>
                    <br>

<figure>
              <img src="bozuk_yansıma.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
    
            </figure>
            
                    <br>

        Because of these reasons we changed our reflection method to
        something simpler. Instead of reflecting the camera, we decided to reflect the
        objects with a modeling matrix change: a reflection matrix.

                    <br>


            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
    
            reflection[0][0] = 1.0f - 2.0f * n.x * n.x;
            reflection[1][1] = 1.0f - 2.0f * n.y * n.y;
            reflection[2][2] = 1.0f - 2.0f * n.z * n.z;
            reflection[3][3] = 1.0f;
            
            reflection[0][1] = -2.0f * n.x * n.y;
            reflection[0][2] = -2.0f * n.x * n.z;
            reflection[1][2] = -2.0f * n.y * n.z;

            reflection[1][0] = -2.0f * n.x * n.y;;
            reflection[2][0] = -2.0f * n.x * n.z;;
            reflection[2][1] = -2.0f * n.y * n.z;; 
            
            reflection[0][3] = -2.0f * n.x * d;
            reflection[1][3] = -2.0f * n.y * d;
            reflection[2][3] = -2.0f * n.z * d;
            
            reflection[3][0] = 0.0f;
            reflection[3][1] = 0.0f;
            reflection[3][2] = 0.0f;
            
            </code></pre>

                    <br>

        This formula is the homogenous-3D version of 2D reflection.

        <h3>Creating the Water</h3>

        In this section, we’ll go through how we designed and developed our water system. What started as a simple flat rectangle turned into a visually dynamic water surface with lighting, reflection, wave motion, and more. We'll cover the journey step by step: from the first attempts, through our problem-solving process, to the final version.

        <br><br>

        <h4>First Attempt: The Simplest Water</h4>

        <br>

        To begin with, we created a simple flat plane and added a basic water texture. We experimented with simple sinusoidal lighting distortions using position and time.

        <br>

        We started with the most basic idea: take a small rectangle, apply a procedural texture based on coordinates, and slightly distort it with lighting variations.

        <br>


        <video width="100%" controls>
            <source src="initial_water.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        Nice :) We had something that resembled water, maybe from a game made before 1995. A fun start, but nowhere near realistic.

        

        <br><br>

        <h4>Trying Better Shapes</h4>

        <br>

        A rectangular lake felt unnatural. Real water bodies are rarely rectangles they are usually freeform. We thought it was time to use the holy Bézier curves we learned in Computer Graphics.

        <br>

        We wrote a Python script using matplotlib to draw Bézier curves and extract their shapes. With this method, we could define and generate ponds of any form.

        <br>

        <figure>
              <img src="bezier_curve_drawer.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
    
        </figure> 
        
        <br>
        This is an example pond with lighting distortions in OpenGL:
        <br>
        
        <video width="100%" controls>
            <source src="roundish_water.webm" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <br>

        However, this approach had one downside: rendering the environment and reflections on an irregular surface was going to be expensive and rendering a gound was not part of the original project scope. So we went back to a simpler decision, a large water plane that covers the entire ground. Problem solved.

        <br><br>

        <h4>Adding Movement with Simple Waves</h4>

        <br>

        We then added basic wave displacement. A single sine wave moved the surface up and down with time.

        <br>

        [Video of the second wave trial]

        <br>

        It wasn’t great, but the water moved! It also responded to lighting (although it was buggy).

        <video width="100%" controls>
            <source src="initial_wave.webm" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <br><br>

        <h4>Multiple Waves and Color Variation</h4>

        <br>

        Obviously we needed more complexity. We increased the number of wave functions to four, each with different directions, amplitudes, and speeds. We also increased the water area and introduced color blending: deeper parts became darker blue, and peaks became lighter.

        <br>

        We took inspiration from this helpful video:  
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfagLeUa7k&t=182s&ab_channel=Acerola" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfagLeUa7k</a>

        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        Here are the techniques we applied in the vertex shader:

        <ul>
        <li><b>Wave displacement:</b> Multiple Gerstner waves move the surface vertices to create realistic ripples and peaks.</li>
        <li><b>Normal calculation:</b> Normals are recalculated based on wave slopes to ensure correct lighting and reflections.</li>
        <li><b>Directional waves:</b> Supports both fixed direction waves and circular waves spreading from a point.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        And in the fragment shader:

        <ul>
        <li><b>Normal smoothing:</b> Slightly smooths normals to avoid harsh lighting artifacts.</li>
        <li><b>Depth-based color:</b> Water color shifts from light to dark blue based on fragment height.</li>
        <li><b>Lighting:</b> Applies diffuse and specular lighting with the Blinn-Phong model.</li>
        <li><b>Specular dampening:</b> Reduces highlights on wave peaks to simulate rougher surfaces.</li>
        <li><b>Fresnel effect:</b> Increases reflectivity at glancing angles for shiny edges.</li>
        <li><b>Gamma correction:</b> Corrects colors for natural display on screen.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>


        <h4>Wave Structure</h4>

        <br>

        Each wave is defined by parameters like amplitude, wavelength, direction, and speed. The final displacement of the water surface is simply the sum of these wave functions:

        <pre><code class="language-glsl">
        float waveHeight = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i) {
            waveHeight += amplitude[i] * sin(dot(direction[i], worldPos.xz) * wavelength[i] + time * speed[i]);
        }
        </code></pre>

        This combination gave us non-uniform, animated surface motion.

        </video>

        <br><br>

        <h4>Adding Randomness with Lerp</h4>

        <br>

        Still, something was missing, randomness. We implemented a time-based transition between random sets of wave parameters using linear interpolation (lerp), another technique from computer grapics course. At regular intervals, we generate new wave configurations and blend from the old ones to the new. This made the movement less predictable and more natural.

        <br>
        

        <h4>The Moving Water Bug</h4>

        <br>

        After rendering the water with the cubemap and the sakura tree, we encountered a weird issue: the water seemed to follow the camera. For an hour, we blamed our water shader, we tweaked code, adjusted math, etc.

        <br>

        Eventually, we drew a simple grid using OpenGL’s legacy draw calls and realized the issue wasn’t with the water.

        <br>

        The actual problem was <b>depth testing</b>. The tree was blending with the water without proper depth, causing the illusion that water always remained in front of the camera. Enabling depth testing before rendering the water fixed the problem instantly.

        <br>
        
        <video width="100%" controls>
            <source src="render-problem.webm" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <br>

        <h4>Adding Reflection</h4>

        <br>

        We connected the cubemap texture to the water shader and used the surface normals to sample from it. The result: convincing reflections of the tree and sky across the water.
        (As you can see the flowers of the tree are still not included in the depth testing. Another problem waiting for solution.)

            <source src="cubemap-blend.webm" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        
        <br>

        <h4>Fixing the Tiling</h4>

        <br>

        While the reflections worked well, the waves still looked repetitive. The surface had too much motion and appeared heavily tiled.

        <br>

        After trying many parameter tweaks, we turned to a new approach: <b>Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm)</b>.

        <br>

        Here’s how it works:

        <ul>
        <li>Stack multiple sine waves, each with increasing frequency and decreasing amplitude.</li>
        <li>This gives us subtle, high-frequency ripples on top of larger base waves.</li>
        <li>The surface looks much more natural and less uniform.</li>
        </ul>

        We also found that almost-still water with minimal motion was visually the most appealing. This is the result after tweaks (And before many other tweaks :))

        <h4>Edge Fog</h4>

        <br>

        The sharp edges of the water plane were breaking the realism. To hide them, we applied a simple fog effect based on the distance from the camera.

        <br>

        Surprisingly, this didn’t just solve the edge problem, it also added a beautiful fading effect to the horizon.

        <br><br>

        <h4>Improving the Lerp Logic</h4>

        <br>

        Our original random lerp logic was unpredictable. It sometimes got stuck, jumped too fast, or stopped entirely. We refined the logic:

        <ul>
        <li>Render using the initial wave configuration.</li>
        <li>Periodically generate a new wave set and lerp toward it.</li>
        <li>After completion, lerp back to the original configuration.</li>
        </ul>

        This gave us subtle transitions and a controlled loop.

        <h4>Distorting Reflections</h4>

        <br>

        As a final touch, we added a slight distortion to the reflection of the tree based on its Y position and the camera’s view direction. This gave the reflection a watery appearance, especially noticeable at steep angles.

        <br>

        <h5>How It Works:</h5>

        <ul>
        <li>In the vertex shader, we pass texture coordinates and world position to the fragment shader.</li>
        <li>In the fragment shader, we use normal perturbation, position.y value and view direction to create distortion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

        <br>

        That’s it. All of these steps from replacing a flat plane to blending wave sets, handling cubemaps, adding fog, and fixing bugs, came together to create a dynamic, realistic water surface. It wasn’t easy, but it was worth it.

        Final Notes & Potential Improvements
        </h1>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Flower flickering bug:</b> On one of our computers, the falling flowers flicker randomly. We couldn’t find the exact cause. Sometimes it renders fine, as seen in the final video, but other times it glitches frequently.</li>
          
          <li><b>Flower reflections:</b> The shedding flowers currently appear on the water, but their reflections are not distorted by the water surface. This visual detail could be added to enhance realism.</li>
          
          <li><b>Wave interactions (Domain Warping):</b> We currently use multiple independent waves. A potential improvement is <i>domain warping</i>, which means feeding one wave’s output into the input of another. This causes waves to distort each other, creating more complex and natural interactions on the surface.</li>
        </ul>
